## Repro for slow dotnet watch with Blazor on .NET9

- [dotnet 9, "dotnet watch" is really bad in Blazor Server 路 Issue \#45810 路 dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/45810)

## Problem
`dotnet watch` is much slower (10-20 seconds vs ~1 second) to apply small changes to `.razor` files in Blazor, after upgrading from .NET SDK 8.0.407 to 9.x.
Have tried `9.0.202` and `9.0.300-preview.0.25174.3` with no success.

## To run this sample
Run both projects in two separate shells:
```sh
dotnet watch --verbose --project BlazorServer8HotReloadRepro
```

```sh
dotnet watch --verbose --project BlazorServer9HotReloadRepro
```

- Wait for browser to launch for each project.
- Edit `Components/Pages/Home.razor` in either project, and change the title text or something trivial.
- Observe in console output that `OnInitializedAsync` is run twice on net9, once on net8


## Observations
A couple of observations in these template apps:
- `dotnet watch --verbose` produces a very long list of files on every change in net9, no such details shown in net8
- `OnInitializedAsync` for `Home.razor` is run twice in net9, once in net8
- Simulating a slow `OnInitializedAsync` with Task.Delay, delays the hot reload on both
- TODO Reproduce a "full page load" as seen in our large, proprietary Blazor app

Observations in our proprietary, large Blazor Server code base with many projects, code and components:
- On net9, hot reload incurs what seems like a full page load. A new circuit is started, services are created and data is initialized. This is slow in our app, but this page load did not happen in net8 hot reload.
